# 📧 Spam Email Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam**. It leverages natural language processing techniques to preprocess email content and employs classification algorithms to accurately detect spam emails.

## 📝 Project Overview

The primary goal is to develop a reliable spam detection system that can be integrated into email clients or servers to filter out unwanted messages, enhancing user experience and security.

## 📂 Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam emails. Each entry in the dataset includes:

- **Email Text**: The raw content of the email.
- **Label**: Indicates whether the email is 'spam' or 'ham' (not spam).

*Note: Ensure that the dataset is preprocessed to handle issues like missing values, inconsistent formatting, and encoding problems.*

## ⚙️ Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Conversion of text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score to assess model performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-email-classification
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## 📈 Results

The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **Precision**: 94%
- **Recall**: 96%
- **F1-Score**: 95%

*Note: These metrics are based on the current dataset and model configuration. Results may vary with different datasets or model parameters.*

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Incorporate deep learning models like RNNs or Transformers for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI.
- Implement real-time spam detection for incoming emails.
